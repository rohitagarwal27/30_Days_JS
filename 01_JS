# JavaScript Variables and Data Types

## Day 1: Variables and Data Types

### Tasks/Activities:

#### Activity 1: Variable Declaration

**Task 1:**
- Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.

**Task 2:**
- Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

#### Activity 2: Constant Declaration

**Task 3:**
- Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

#### Activity 3: Data Types

**Task 4:**
- Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

#### Activity 4: Reassigning Variables

**Task 5:**
- Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

#### Activity 5: Understanding `const`

**Task 6:**
- Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

### Feature Requests:

1. **Variable Types Console Log:** Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

2. **Reassignment Demo:** Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

### Achievements:
By the end of these activities, you will:
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
